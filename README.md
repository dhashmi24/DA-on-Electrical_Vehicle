# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

This project explores Electric Vehicle (EV) data to provide insights into the trends, distribution, and growth of EVs across different states and manufacturers in the United States. The analysis includes several key components:

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The project uses a comprehensive dataset of electric vehicles, including attributes such as make, model, model year, electric range, and geographical information (state and postal code).
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted both univariate and bivariate analyses to understand the characteristics of the dataset and the relationships between various factors.

## Key Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Performed visualizations to analyze the distribution of electric vehicles by make, model, and year.
   - Investigated correlations between features such as electric range and vehicle type.

2. **Choropleth Map**:
   - Created an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly Express to display the number of EVs by location over time.
   - The map provides a visual representation of EV distribution across different states.

3. **Racing Bar Plot**:
   - Developed a Racing Bar Plot to animate the count of EVs by make over the years, showcasing trends in the electric vehicle market.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
